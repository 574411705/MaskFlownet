## Pre-trained Models

Here, we provide three pre-trained models,

- `771Sep25-0735_500000.params`, the pre-trained *MaskFlownet-S* model, which has been trained on Flying Chairs and Flying Things3D, and it should be evaluated on Sintel *train* + *val* (corresponding to one in step 2).

- `dbbSep30-1206_1000000.params`, the pre-trained *MaskFlownet-S* model, which has been trained on Flying Chairs, Flying Things3D, and Sintel *train*, and it should be evaluated on Sintel *val* (corresponding to one in step 3).

- `5adNov03-0005_1000000.params`, the pre-trained *MaskFlownet* model, which has been trained on Flying Chairs, Flying Things3D, and Sintel *train*, and it should be evaluated on Sintel *val* (corresponding to one in step 6).
